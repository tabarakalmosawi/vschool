   <p> The word chelonian is popular among veterinarians, scientists, and conservationists working with these animals as a catch-all name for any member of the superorder Chelonia, which includes all turtles living and extinct, as well as their immediate ancestors.[citation needed] Chelonia is based on the Greek word χελώνη chelone "tortoise", "turtle" (another relevant word is χέλυς chelys "tortoise"),[8][9] also denoting armor or interlocking shields;[10] testudines, on the other hand, is based on the Latin word testudo "tortoise".[11] "Turtle" may either refer to the order as a whole, or to particular turtles that make up a form taxon that is not monophyletic.

The meaning of the word turtle differs from region to region. In North America, all chelonians are commonly called turtles, including terrapins and tortoises.[12][13] In Great Britain, the word turtle is used for sea-dwelling species, but not for tortoises.
